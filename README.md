# MVWA - Modern Vulnerable Web Application

**MVWA** is a modern, intentionally vulnerable web application built to help developers, security professionals, and students learn real-world web app security by attacking and fixing live code.

### üî• Inspired By:
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Real-world attack surfaces and DevSecOps practices

### üì¶ Phase 1 - Core MVP
- Node.js + Express backend
- MongoDB database
- React frontend (with poor input validation)
- Dockerized setup
- Vulnerabilities: SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, broken auth, etc.

### üöß Roadmap
| Phase | Focus                             | Complexity |
|-------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1     | MVP app w/ classic OWASP flaws   | Beginner   |
| 2     | Modern auth, API, SSRF, uploads  | Intermediate |
| 3     | DevSecOps + CI/CD vulns + RCE    | Advanced   |

### üîê Learn Web Security Hands-On
Use tools like:
- Kali Linux / Burp Suite / ZAP
- Nuclei, Nikto, Metasploit
- Docker / GitHub Actions / Kubernetes
